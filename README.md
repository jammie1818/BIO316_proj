# BIO316_proj
This is a repository for my final project in BIO 316.

With this project I hope to visualize the effects that coral bleaching has on the distribution of three species in the Philippines. 

This project contains code chunks which require you to install (if necessary) and load the following packages into R: sf, rgdal, ggplot2, raster, spatial, dplyr, mapr, dismo, spocc, ENMeval, tibble, rinat, maptools, maps, png, and grid.

No additional software is necessary to reproduce this code or render the HTML file.
